We hold to beliefs which reflect the simple teaching of Jesus Christ and his Apostles. Our rule of life is to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and his disciples. Our hopes are centered upon the return of Jesus, when he will bring everlasting life to the faithful and set up on earth the long-promised Kingdom of God, which will be the restored Kingdom of Israel under divine leadership.
