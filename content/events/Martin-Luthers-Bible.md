One of the stimuli for the reformation had been Paul's letter to the Church at Rome. Luther's understanding of Romans emphasized the importance of gaining understanding of the scriptures and then accepting personal responsibility for ones own salvation. As a result, it was essential, in the eyes of the reformers, that the Bible should be available in each person's native language. People should be permitted to own, read or listen to the Bible in their own language. Martin Luther was one of the strongest voices in the Reformation for the freedom to own and read the Bible. The Bible was not the only book available. The printing press had made it possible to produce large numbers of volumes and the desire for books and learning was growing.

Martin Luther's translation into German, printed in 1522, was based on the Greek text prepared by Erasmus, which had been printed in 1516. Erasmus had collated one complete Greek New Testament from six partial manuscripts. Manuscripts of the Bible in Greek had become available in Europe after Greek scholars migrated to Western Europe following the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453. Comparisons between these Greek manuscripts and the Latin Vulgate, which was the standard text throughout Europe at that time, were in part the stimulation for a renewed study of Biblical texts in the 16th Century.

Starting in 1506, the Pope had authorized indulgences to pay for the costs to build the new St. Peter's church in Rome. This practice was in stark contrast to the conclusions that Luther had reached on personal responsibility. His conclusions seem obvious today and Luther seems to have intended to stimulate an academic debate, but the 95 theses that he expounded and nailed to the door of Wittenburg church had far reaching effects.

The 1546 Version is the last edition of Luther's Bible prior to his death in 1546. Luther's translation is still being published in Germany today.

Martin Luther provided a refuge to William Tyndale for a time after Tyndale had left England for the Continent. Luther's influence on Tyndale was considerable. The prologue to William Tyndale's New Testament obviously has a heart warming evangelical tone, which is based upon Luther's discussions. Tyndale's comments on the relation between law and the gospel were obviously Lutheran and must have sounded threatening to the church authorities of that day.

Many of Luther's marginal notes and his references to parallel verses are used by Tyndale in his New Testament. Also, much of Tyndale's commentary is based on Luther, although by no means as fierce in tone.
