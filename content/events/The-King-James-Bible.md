When Elizabeth I died in 1603, James I succeeded to the English throne. At this time the Geneva Bible was very popular throughout both England and Scotland. James welcomed a proposal to prepare another translation because, as he put it, 'I could never yet see a Bible well translated in English; but I think, of all, that the Geneva is the worst'. It appears, however, that the marginal notes offended James the most.

In 1604, the year after he became King of England, James convened the Hampton Conference. At this conference, a resolution was passed 'That a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as can be to the original Hebrew and Greek'.

King James I took a leading part in organizing the translation, five committees prepared a new text, the Old Testament was entrusted to three and the New Testament to two. A sub-committee selected from the five reviewed the final text. Great care was taken to prepare the text that was majestic and carried a sense of the Divine by its expressiveness.

The basis for this new translation was the Bishop's Bible and the Hebrew and Greek texts available at that time were used extensively.

Rules for translating were similar to those for the Bishop's Bible, i.e. to avoid controversy in both text and reference notes. The names of Bible characters were to correspond as closely as possible to common usage. This was in sharp contrast to the Geneva Bible and the Bishop's Bible that expressed Jewish names in Hebrew form. Old ecclesiastical words were to be kept, for example, church and not congregation. This insistence on approved wording was a reaction to the strong puritan influence of the previous translators, Coverdale, for instance.

The text of the King James Bible, first printed in 1611, became the accepted version of the English Bible until the Revised Version was published; the New Testament in 1881 and the Old Testament in 1885.

This translation has glowing dedication to the King and official sanction but the Geneva Bible continued to be very popular.

The greatest defect of the King James Bible is that the New Testament was translated from an inferior text. This Greek text was made in the Fourth Century and it is now known that it is quite removed from the text of the First Century. Sixteen years after the King James Bible was printed, a Greek manuscript of the Bible was presented to King Charles I. This Fifth Century manuscript is now known as the Alexandrine Codex and is in the British Museum. At that time, this was a much better manuscript than the text prepared by Erasmus and used by the translators of the King James Bible. Unfortunately, it was not available to the translators in 1611.
